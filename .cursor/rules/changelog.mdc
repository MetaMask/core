# Changelog rules

- When updating a CHANGELOG.md, prefix breaking change entries with `**BREAKING:**` and list them above non-breaking entries in the same category section.
- A change is breaking if it removes, renames, or changes the signature of any public export (function, type, class, constant), or changes default behavior that consumers rely on.
