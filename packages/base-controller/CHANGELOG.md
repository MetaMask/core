## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - `src/BaseController.ts`
    - `src/BaseController.test.ts`
    - `src/BaseControllerV2.ts`
    - `src/BaseControllerV2.test.ts`
    - `src/ComposableController.ts`
    - `src/ComposableController.test.ts`
    - `src/ControllerMessenger.ts`
    - `src/ControllerMessenger.test.ts`

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
