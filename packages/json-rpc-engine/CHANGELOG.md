## [7.2.0]
### Added
- Applied eslint rules from core monorepo ([#172](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/172))

## [7.1.1]
### Changed
- Bumped `@metamask/utils` from `^5.0.2` to `^8.1.0` [#158](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/158) ([#162](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/162))
- Bumped `@metamask/rpc-errors` from `^5.0.0` to `^6.0.0` ([#162](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/162))

## [7.1.0]
### Changed
- Bumped `@metamask/safe-event-emitter` from `^2.0.0` to `^3.0.0` ([#148](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/148))
- Bumped `@metamask/utils` from `^5.0.1` to `^5.0.2` ([#151](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/151))

### Fixed
- Fixed handling of empty batch array in requests ([#153](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/153))

## [7.0.0]
### Added
- Added JSON-RPC notification handling ([#104](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/104))
- Added `destroy` method ([#106](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/106))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Require a minimum Node version of 16 ([#139](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/139))
- **BREAKING:** Use `@metamask/utils` types ([#105](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/105))
  - The JSON-RPC engine and all middleware now use `@metamask/utils` JSON-RPC types
- **(BREAKING)** Return a `null` instead of `undefined` response `id` for malformed request objects ([#91](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/91))
  - This is very unlikely to be breaking in practice, but the behavior could have been relied on.
- Change package name to `@metamask/json-rpc-engine` ([#139](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/139))
- Use `@metamask/rpc-errors` ([#138](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/138))

## [6.1.0] - 2020-11-20
### Added
- Add `PendingJsonRpcResponse` interface for use in middleware ([#75](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/75))

### Changed
- Use `async`/`await` and `try`/`catch` instead of Promise methods everywhere ([#74](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/74))
  - Consumers may notice improved stack traces on certain platforms.

## [6.0.0] - 2020-11-19
### Added
- Add docstrings for public `JsonRpcEngine` methods ([#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/70))

### Changed
- **(BREAKING)** Refactor exports ([#69](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/69))
  - All exports are now named, and available via the package entry point.
  - All default exports have been removed.
- **(BREAKING)** Convert `asMiddleware` to instance method ([#69](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/69))
  - The `asMiddleware` export has been removed.
- **(BREAKING)** Add runtime typechecks to `JsonRpcEngine.handle()`, and error responses if they fail ([#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/70))
  - Requests will now error if:
    - The request is not a plain object, or if the `method` property is not a `string`. Empty strings are allowed.
    - A `next` middleware callback is called with a truthy, non-function parameter.
- Migrate to TypeScript ([#69](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/69))
- Hopefully improve stack traces by removing uses of `Promise.then` and `.catch` internally ([#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/70))
- Make some internal `JsonRpcEngine` methods `static` ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/71))

## [5.4.0] - 2020-11-07
### Changed
- Make the TypeScript types not terrible ([#66](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/66), [#67](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/67))

## [5.3.0] - 2020-07-30
### Changed
- Response object errors no longer include a `stack` property

## [5.2.0] - 2020-07-24
### Added
- Promise signatures for `engine.handle` ([#55](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/pull/55))
  - So, in addition to `engine.handle(request, callback)`, you can do e.g. `await engine.handle(request)`.

### Changed
- Remove `async` and `promise-to-callback` dependencies
  - These dependencies were used internally for middleware flow control.
    They have been replaced with Promises and native `async`/`await`, which means that some operations are _no longer_ eagerly executed.
    This change may affect consumers that depend on the eager execution of middleware _during_ request processing, _outside of_ middleware functions and request handlers.
    - In general, it is a bad practice to work with state that depends on middleware execution, while the middleware are executing.
