 * throw an error, and if it returns a promise, that promise can either be
 * resolved with a response object or reject with an error.
 *
 * @property request - Looks for a request matching these specifications.
 * @property request.method - The RPC method to which this stub will be matched.
 * @property request.params - The params to which this stub will be matched.
 * @property response - Instructs `sendAsync` to return a promise that resolves
 * with a response object.
 * @property response.result - Specifies a successful response, with this as the
 * `result`.
 * @property response.error - Specifies an error response, with this as the
 * `error`.
 * @property error - Instructs `sendAsync` to return a promise that rejects with
 * this error.
 * @property implementation - Allows overriding `sendAsync` entirely. Useful if
 * you want it to throw an error.
 * @property delay - The amount of time that will pass after the callback is
 * called with the response.
 * @property discardAfterMatching - Usually after the stub matches a request, it
 * is discarded, but setting this to true prevents that from happening. True by
 * default.
