## [Unreleased]

## [6.0.0]
### Added
- Add rollbackToPreviousProvider method ([#1132](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1132))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Migrate network configurations from `PreferencesController` to `NetworkController` ([#1064](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1064))
  - Consumers will need to adapt to reading network data from `NetworkConfigurations` state on `NetworkController` rather than `frequentRpcList` on `PreferencesController`.
  - `setRpcTarget` becomes `setActiveNetwork` on `NetworkController` and accepts a `networkConfigurationId` argument rather than an `rpcUrl`.
  - `addToFrequentRpcList` on `PreferencesController` becomes `upsertNetworkConfiguration` on `NetworkController`.
  - `removeFromFrequentRpcList` on `PreferencesController` becomes `removeNetworkConfiguration` on `NetworkController`
  - The `NetworkController` requires a `trackMetaMetricsEvent` callback function argument in its constructor.
- **BREAKING:** Expose `getProviderAndBlockTracker` instead of `provider` ([#1091](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1091))
  - This change is breaking because it removes the provider property from `NetworkController`. Instead, a new method `getProviderAndBlockTracker` method is available for accessing the current provider object.

## [5.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename `properties` property in state object to `networkDetails` ([#1074](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1074))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove `isomorphic-fetch` ([#1106](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1106))
  - Consumers must now import `isomorphic-fetch` or another polyfill themselves if they are running in an environment without `fetch`

## [4.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update type of state object by renaming `properties` property to `networkDetails` ([#1074](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1074))
  - Consumers are recommended to add a state migration for this change.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `NetworkProperties` type to `NetworkDetails` ([#1074](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1074))
- Change `getEIP1559Compatibility` to use async await syntax ([#1084](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1084))

## [3.0.0]
### Added
- Add support for Sepolia as a built-in Infura network ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041))
- Export types for network controller events and actions ([#1039](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1039))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Make `lookupNetwork` block on completing the lookup ([#1063](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1063))
  - This function was always `async`, but it would return before completing any async work. Now it will not return until after the network lookup has been completed.
- Rename this repository to `core` ([#1031](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1031))
- Update `@metamask/controller-utils` package ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041)) 

### Removed
- **BREAKING:**: Drop support for Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan as built-in Infura networks ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041))

## [2.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update type of state object by renaming `provider` property to `providerConfig` ([#995](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/995))
  - Consumers are recommended to add a state migration for this change.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `NetworkController:providerChange` messenger event to `NetworkController:providerConfigChange` ([#995](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/995))
- Relax dependencies on `@metamask/base-controller` and `@metamask/controller-utils` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - Everything in `src/network` (minus `NetworkType` and `NetworksChainId`, which were placed in `@metamask/controller-utils`)

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
