## [4.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update type of state object by renaming `properties` property to `networkDetails` ([#1074](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1074))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Make `lookupNetwork` block on completing the lookup ([#1063](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1063))
  - This function was always `async`, but it would return before completing any async work. Now it will not return until after the network lookup has been completed.

- Relax dependencies on `@metamask/base-controller` and `@metamask/controller-utils` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - Everything in `src/network` (minus `NetworkType` and `NetworksChainId`, which were placed in `@metamask/controller-utils`)

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
