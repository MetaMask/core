## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1]
### Changed
- Relax dependencies on `@metamask/base-controller`, `@metamask/controller-utils`, `@metamask/message-manager`, and `@metamask/preferences-controller` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - Everything in `src/keyring`

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
