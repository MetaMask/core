# `@metamask/queued-request-controller`

Includes a controller and middleware that implements a request queue. A request queue allows for intelligently switching of the globally selected network based on the dapps selected network. It ultimately allows us to handle requests with an intended destination network that is different than the currently selected network.

## Installation

`yarn add @metamask/queued-request-controller`
