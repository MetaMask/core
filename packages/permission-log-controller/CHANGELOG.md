## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.1]

### Changed

- Bump `@metamask/utils` from `^8.3.0` to `^9.1.0` ([#4516](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4516), [#4529](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4529))
- Bump `@metamask/rpc-errors` from `^6.2.1` to `^6.3.1` ([#4516](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4516))
- Bump TypeScript from `~4.9.5` to `~5.2.2` and set `moduleResolution` option to `Node16` ([#3645](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/3645), [#4576](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4576), [#4584](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4584))

### Fixed

- Produce and export ESM-compatible TypeScript type declaration files in addition to CommonJS-compatible declaration files ([#4648](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4648))
  - Previously, this package shipped with only one variant of type declaration
    files, and these files were only CommonJS-compatible, and the `exports`
    field in `package.json` linked to these files. This is an anti-pattern and
    was rightfully flagged by the
    ["Are the Types Wrong?"](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/) tool as
    ["masquerading as CJS"](https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/FalseCJS.md).
    All of the ATTW checks now pass.
- Remove chunk files ([#4648](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/4648)).
  - Previously, the build tool we used to generate JavaScript files extracted
    common code to "chunk" files. While this was intended to make this package
    more tree-shakeable, it also made debugging more difficult for our
    development teams. These chunk files are no longer present.
