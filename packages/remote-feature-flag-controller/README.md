# `@metamask/remote-feature-flag-controller`

The RemoteFeatureFlagController manages the retrieval and caching of remote feature flags. It fetches feature flags from a remote API, caches them, and provides methods to access and manage these flags. The controller ensures that feature flags are refreshed based on a specified interval and handles cases where the controller is disabled or the network is unavailable.

## Installation

`yarn add @metamask/remote-feature-flag-controller`
