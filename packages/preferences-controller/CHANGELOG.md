## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2]

- Update `@metamask/controller-utils` package ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041)) 

## [1.0.1]
### Changed
- Relax dependencies on `@metamask/base-controller` and `@metamask/controller-utils` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - `src/user/PreferencesController.ts` (plus `ContactEntry` copied from `src/user/AddressBookController.ts`)
    - `src/user/PreferencesController.test.ts`

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
