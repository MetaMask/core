// This is a placeholder test file. The real unit tests for PerpsController
// live in Mobile (source of truth). This file exists solely to satisfy
// Core's CI requirement that every package has at least one test.
//
// It lives in tests/ (not src/) so the Mobile sync script (which uses
// rsync --delete on src/) does not remove it.
//
// Remove this file when tests are migrated from Mobile to Core.
