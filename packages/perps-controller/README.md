# `@metamask/perps-controller`

Controller for perpetual trading functionality in MetaMask.

## Installation

`yarn add @metamask/perps-controller`

or

`npm install @metamask/perps-controller`

## Usage

`PerpsController` provides a provider-agnostic API for perpetual trading. It
normalizes market data, account state, trading, funding, transfers, risk
calculations, and live subscriptions across enabled providers.

Applications construct the controller with a messenger and their
platform-specific dependencies:

```typescript
import {
  PerpsController,
  type PerpsControllerOptions,
} from '@metamask/perps-controller';

export async function createPerpsController(
  options: PerpsControllerOptions,
): Promise<PerpsController> {
  const controller = new PerpsController(options);
  await controller.init();
  return controller;
}
```

The controller registers its public operations as `PerpsController:*`
messenger actions, and clients can call the same methods directly. Its main
capabilities are:

- Provider and network lifecycle management.
- Normalized market, account, position, order, and history reads.
- Trading, position, margin, deposit, and withdrawal operations with
  preflight validation and risk calculations.
- Callback-based live prices, positions, orders, fills, order books, and
  candles. Each subscription returns an unsubscribe function.

The package exports the controller's parameter, result, provider, and
messenger types for client integrations. Provider availability and aggregated
routing are controlled by client configuration and feature flags.
