## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Allow `RateLimitController` to define a rate-limit per method ([#1355](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1355))
  - The constructor `implementations` option now maps API names to objects with a `method` property, rather than mapping to a function. This object may also have `rateLimitCount` and `rateLimitTimeout` properties, allowing custom rate limits for that method.
- **BREAKING:** Bump to Node 16 ([#1262](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1262))

## [2.0.1]
### Changed
- deps: eth-rpc-errors@4.0.0->4.0.2 ([#1215](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1215))

## [2.0.0]
### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove `isomorphic-fetch` ([#1106](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1106))
  - Consumers must now import `isomorphic-fetch` or another polyfill themselves if they are running in an environment without `fetch`

## [1.0.2]
### Changed
- Rename this repository to `core` ([#1031](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1031))
- Update `@metamask/controller-utils` package ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041))

## [1.0.1]
### Changed
- Relax dependency on `@metamask/base-controller` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - Everything in `src/ratelimit`

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
