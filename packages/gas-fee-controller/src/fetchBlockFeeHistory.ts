 * @param args.numberOfBlocks - How many total blocks to fetch. Note that if this is more than 1024,
 * multiple calls to `eth_feeHistory` will be made.
 * @param args.percentiles - A set of numbers between 1 and 100 which will dictate how
 * `priorityFeesByPercentile` in each returned block will be formed. When Ethereum runs the
 * `eth_feeHistory` method, for each block it is considering, it will first sort all transactions by
 * the priority fee. It will then go through each transaction and add the total amount of gas paid
 * for that transaction to a bucket which maxes out at the total gas used for the whole block. As
 * the bucket fills, it will cross percentages which correspond to the percentiles specified here,
 * and the priority fees of the first transactions which cause it to reach those percentages will be
 * recorded. Hence, `priorityFeesByPercentile` represents the priority fees of transactions at key
 * gas used contribution levels, where earlier levels have smaller contributions and later levels
 * have higher contributions.
 * @param args.includeNextBlock - Whether to include an extra block that represents the next
 * block after the latest one. Only the `baseFeePerGas` will be filled in for this block (which is
 * estimated).
