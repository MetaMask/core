## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update `@metamask/network-controller` peer dependency to v3 ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041))
- Rename this repository to `core` ([#1031](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1031))
- Update `@metamask/controller-utils` package ([#1041](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/1041)) 

## [2.0.1]
### Fixed
- This package will now warn if a required package is not present ([#1003](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1003))

## [2.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Bump `@metamask/network-controller` to 2.0.0 ([#995](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/995))
  - GasFeeController now expects NetworkController to respond to the `NetworkController:providerChangeConfig` event (previously named `NetworkController:providerChange`). If you are depending directly on `@metamask/network-controller`, you should update your version to at least 2.0.0 as well.
- Relax dependencies on `@metamask/base-controller`, `@metamask/controller-utils`, and `@metamask/network-controller` (use `^` instead of `~`) ([#998](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/998))

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release
  - As a result of converting our shared controllers repo into a monorepo ([#831](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/831)), we've created this package from select parts of [`@metamask/controllers` v33.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/v33.0.0), namely:
    - Everything in `src/gas`

    All changes listed after this point were applied to this package following the monorepo conversion.
