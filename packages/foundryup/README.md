# `@metamask/foundryup`

foundryup

## Installation

`yarn add @metamask/foundryup`

or

`npm install @metamask/foundryup`

## Usage

Once installed into a package you can do `yarn bin mm-foundryup`.

This will install the latest version of Foundry things by default.

Try `yarn bin mm-foundryup --help` for more options.

Once you have the binaries installed, you have to figure out how to get to them.

Probably best to just add each as a `package.json` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "anvil": "node_modules/.bin/anvil",
}
```

Kind of weird, but it seems to work okay. You can probably use `npx anvil` in place of `node_modules/.bin/anvil`, but
getting it to work in all scenarios (cross platform and in CI) wasn't straightforward. `yarn bin anvil` doesn't work
in yarn v4 because it isn't a bin of `@metamask/foundryup`, so yarn pretends it doesn't exist.

This all needs to work.

You can try it here in the monorepo by running `yarn workspace @metamask/foundryup anvil`.
