## [Unreleased]

### Changed

## [4.0.0]

### Added

- **BREAKING**: `getSessionScopes()` now expects an additional hooks object as its last param. The hooks object should have a `getNonEvmSupportedMethods` property whose value should be a function that accepts a `CaipChainId` and returns an array of supported methods. ([#5191](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/5191))
- **BREAKING**: `caip25CaveatBuilder()` now expects two additional properties it's singular param object. The param object should now also have a `isNonEvmScopeSupported` property whose value should be a function that accepts a `CaipChainId` and returns a boolean, and a `getNonEvmAccountAddresses` property whose value should be a function that accepts a `CaipChainId` and returns an array of CAIP-10 account addresses. ([#5191](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/5191))
  - The CAIP-25 caveat specification now also validates if non-evm scopes and accounts are supported
- **BREAKING**: The `wallet_getSession` handler now expects `getNonEvmSupportedMethods` to be provided in it's hooks. ([#5191](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/5191))
  - The handler now resolves methods for non-evm scopes in the returned `sessionScopes` result
- **BREAKING**: The `wallet_invokeMethod` handler now expects `getNonEvmSupportedMethods` and `handleNonEvmRequestForOrigin` to be provided in it's hooks. ([#5191](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/5191))

  - `handleNonEvmRequestForOrigin` should be a function with the following signature:
    ```
     handleNonEvmRequestForOrigin: (params: {
       connectedAddresses: CaipAccountId[];
       scope: CaipChainId;

      getNonEvmSupportedMethods: (scope: CaipChainId) => string[];
    }
    ```

    {
      isEvmChainIdSupported: (chainId: Hex) => boolean;

      isNonEvmScopeSupported: (scope: CaipChainId) => boolean;
      getNonEvmSupportedMethods: (scope: CaipChainId) => string[];
