 * may be specified multiple ways: `sendAsync` can either return a promise or
 * throw an error, and if it returns a promise, that promise can either be
 * resolved with a response object or reject with an error.
 *
 * @property methodName - The RPC method to which this stub will be matched.
 * @property response - Instructs `sendAsync` to return a promise that resolves
 * with a response object.
 * @property response.result - Specifies a successful response, with this as the
 * `result`.
 * @property response.error - Specifies an error response, with this as the
 * `error`.
 * @property implementation - Allows overriding `sendAsync` entirely. Useful if
 * you want it to throw an error.
 * @property error - Instructs `sendAsync` to return a promise that rejects with
 * this error.
