## [Unreleased]

## [7.0.1]
### Changed
- Dependency updates:
  - Bump @metamask/utils from 5.0.1 to 5.0.2
    - [#141](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/141)
    - [#144](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/144)
  - Bump @metamask/safe-event-emitter from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 ([#143](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/143))

## [7.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** The type of the `provider` option for `PollingBlockTracker` and `SubscribeBlockTracker` has changed ([#130](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/130))
  - The `provider` option must be compatible with the `SafeEventEmitterProvider` type from `@metamask/eth-json-rpc-middleware`.
  - The new provider type should be mostly equivalent, except that it's now expected to have a `send` method. We don't use that `send` method in this package though.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove the `Provider` exported type ([#130](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/130))
  - We now use `@metamask/eth-json-rpc-provider` for this instead, so there was no need to re-export it.

## [6.1.0]
### Added
- Add back Provider type that was accidentally removed in 6.0.0 ([#117](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/117))

### Fixed
- Align Provider type with `eth-json-rpc-middleware` to prevent typecasting ([#117](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/117))

## [6.0.0]
### Added
- Add logging ([#112](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/112))
  - You will not be able to see log messages by default, but you can turn them on for this library by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `metamask:eth-block-tracker:*` or `metamask:*`.
- Add `destroy` method to block tracker classes ([#106](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/106))
- Update PollingBlockTracker to support new `blockResetDuration` option ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))
- Expose types that represent options to PollingBlockTracker and SubscribeBlockTracker constructors ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Require Node >= 14 ([#113](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/113))
- **BREAKING:** Make BaseBlockTracker abstract ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))
  - If you are using this class directly, you must only use PollingBlockTracker or SubscribeBlockTracker.
- **BREAKING:** Make options for BaseBlockTracker required ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))
  - Subclasses must pass a set of options to `super` in their constructors.
- Make argument to `removeAllListeners` in BaseBlockTracker optional ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))
- **BREAKING:** Update signatures for `_start` and `_end` in BaseBlockTracker ([#103](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/103))
  - Subclasses must provide an implementation for both of these methods; they are no longer no-ops.
  - Both methods must return a promise.
- Update SubscribeBlockTracker to not pass empty `newHeads` parameter to `eth_subscribe` call ([#108](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/108))
  - This change was made because OpenEthereum does not support this parameter. While we've done our best to confirm that this will not be a breaking change for other Ethereum implementations, you will want to confirm no breakages for yours.

### Security
- Add `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` to ensure that install scripts are opt-in for dependencies ([#97](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/97))

## [5.0.1] - 2021-03-25
### Fixed
- Add missing `types` field to `package.json` ([#75](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/75))

## [5.0.0] - 2021-03-25
### Changed
- **(BREAKING)** Refactor exports ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/71))
- **(BREAKING)** Target ES2017, remove ES5 builds ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/71))
- Migrate to TypeScript ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/71))
- Update various dependencies ([#44](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/44), [#49](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/49), [#54](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/54), [#59](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/59), [#61](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/61), [#62](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/62), [#63](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/63), [#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/70), [#72](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/72))

### Removed
- Remove unused production dependencies ([#60](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/60), [#68](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-block-tracker/pull/68))

## [4.4.3] - 2019-08-30
### Added
- Add SubscribeBlockTracker

### Changed
- Change events so that they now only return the block number (internal polling is done via `eth_blockNumber`)
- Add `retryTimeout` and `keepEventLoopActive` to constructor
- Update block trackers to inherit from `safe-event-emitter` rather than EventEmitter

### Removed
- Remove `block` event
  - Please use `latest` or `sync`.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-04-26
### Added
- Add isRunning method
- Add `error` event

### Changed
- Significantly rewrite `eth-block-tracker` (primarily due to optimizing network IO)
- Rename `awaitCurrentBlock` to `getLatestBlock`

### Removed
- Remove `stop`/`start` methods from BlockTrackers
  - BlockTrackers now automatically start and stop based on listener count for the `latest` and `sync` events. You can force a stop by calling the `EventEmitter` method `removeAllListeners`.
- Remove tx body from block
- Remove getTrackingBlock
- Remove start/stop
- Remove test/util/testBlockMiddleware

## [3.0.0] - 2018-04-16
### Changed
- Update published version so main module now exports unprocessed source
- Module includes dist:
  - Bundle: `dist/EthBlockTracker.js`
  - ES5 source: `dist/es5/`
- Rename `lib` to `src`
- Update RpcBlockTracker to be a normal `EventEmitter`
  - It no longer provides a callback to event handlers.

### Fixed
- Fix `awaitCurrentBlock` return value

## [2.0.0] - 2017-06-14
### Added
- Expose EventEmitter interface (via `async-eventemitter`)
- Add `getTrackingBlock`, `getCurrentBlock`, `start`, and `stop`
- Add events: `block`, `latest`, `sync`

## [1.0.0] - 2017-02-03
### Added
- Add RpcBlockTracker
