## [4.4.3] - 2019-08-30

This release is included in the changelog to help illustrate the differences between
major versions `4` and `5`.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-04-26

Significant rewrite of `eth-block-tracker`. Primary reason was optimizing network IO.

BlockTrackers no longer have manual stop/start methods, they now automatically start and stop based on listener count for the `latest` and `sync` events. You can force a stop by calling the `EventEmitter` method `removeAllListeners`.

Events now only return the block number. Internal polling is done via `eth_blockNumber`.
The `block` event has been removed, please use `latest` or `sync`.

### Changed

- Added isRunning method
- Added `error` event
- Renamed awaitCurrentBlock -> getLatestBlock
- Removed tx body from block
- Removed getTrackingBlock
- Removed start/stop
- Removed `block` event
- Removed test/util/testBlockMiddleware

## [3.0.0] - 2018-04-16

### Changed

- npm module main now exports unprocessed source
- Module includes dist:
  - Bundle: `dist/EthBlockTracker.js`
  - ES5 source: `dist/es5/`
- Fixes `awaitCurrentBlock` return value
- `lib` renamed to `src`
- `eth-block-tracker` is now a normal `EventEmitter`, does not provide a callback to event handlers
