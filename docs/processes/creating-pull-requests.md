# Creating pull requests

When submitting a pull request for this repo, take some a bit of extra time to fill out its description. Use the provided template as a guide, paying particular attention to the **Explanation** section. This section is intended for you to explain the purpose and scope of your changes and share knowledge that other engineers might not be able to see from reading the PR alone. Some questions you should seek to answer are:

- What is the motivator for these changes? What need are the changes satisfying? Is there a ticket you can share or can you provide some more context for people who might not be familiar with the domain?
- Are there any changes in particular whose purpose might not be obvious or whose implementation might be difficult to decipher? How do they work?
- If your primary goal was to update one package but you found you had to update another one along the way, why did you do so?
- If you had to upgrade a dependency, why did you do so?
