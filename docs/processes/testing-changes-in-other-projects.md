# Testing changes to packages in other projects

Often it is useful to test in-progress changes to one or more packages in the context of a project before releasing them (particularly when making [breaking changes](./breaking-changes.md)).

There are two ways to do this:

- [Preview builds](./preview-builds.md) _(recommended)_
- [Local builds](./local-builds.md)
