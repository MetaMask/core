 * Advances the provided fake timer by a specified duration in incremental steps.

 * they don't always account for promises or other asynchronous operations that may get enqueued
 * during the timer's duration. By advancing time in incremental steps and flushing promises
 * between each step, this function ensures that both timers and promises are comprehensively processed.

/**
 * It's common when writing tests to need an object which fits the shape of a
 * type. However, some properties are unimportant to a test, and so it's useful
 * if such properties can get filled in with defaults if not explicitly
 * provided, so that a complete version of that object can still be produced.
 *
 * A naive approach to doing this is to define those defaults and then mix them
 * in with overrides using the spread operator; however, this causes issues if
 * creating a default value causes a change in global test state â€” such as
 * causing a mocked function to get called inadvertently.
 *
 * This function solves this problem by allowing defaults to be defined lazily.
 *
 * @param defaults - An object where each value is wrapped in a function so that
 * it doesn't get evaluated unless `overrides` does not contain the key.
 * @param overrides - The values to override the defaults with.
 * @param finalizeObject - An optional function to call which will create the
 * final version of the object. This is useful if you need to customize how a
 * value receives its default version (say, if it needs be calculated based on
 * some other property).
 * @returns The complete version of the object.
